# Simple Maven App
This is a dummy app with some pretty stupid code; but hey! It builds successfully, and even has two unit tests written for it.

I have used this project to create a simple Jenkins pipeline.
You can compile, execute tests and build uber jar. Maven commands for this:
* mvn compile
* mvn test
* mvn package (see maven-shade-plugin)
